# AgentWatch

### Your AI agent is lying to you.
### AgentWatch catches it — before it deletes your database.

```
pip install agentwatch-ai
agentwatch watch "your agent command"
```

*One command. Every failure caught. Before it runs.*

## The Problem Nobody Is Solving

## Performance

**Benchmark results (sample from a developer machine):**

| Scenario | Mean (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Overhead vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Raw agent call (baseline) | 0.45 | 0.60 | 0.78 | – |
| watch() without safety | 0.82 | 1.05 | 1.30 | +82% |
| watch() with safety | 1.12 | 1.45 | 1.78 | +149% |
| Full API round‑trip | 3.85 | 4.60 | 5.20 | +755% |

*All timings are mean, p95 and p99 values computed over 1 000 individual samples on a 2024‑class laptop (Intel i7, 16 GB RAM).*

The measured sync watch() p99 is **1.30 ms**, which exceeds the **< 1 ms** target; async agents are not benchmarked in this script, so no async p99 target is reported.

---

```
Agent runs.
Output looks correct.
Database is corrupted.
You find out 3 hours later when a customer complains.
```

**1 in 20 AI agent requests fail silently in production.**

Current observability tools — Langfuse, Phoenix, Datadog — tell you what happened *after* it happened. By then the damage is done.

The real problem: **an agent that confidently fails is indistinguishable from an agent that correctly succeeds.** 

Unless you have a layer watching the *reasoning*, not just the output.

That layer didn't exist.

**Until now.**

---

## How It Works

AgentWatch sits between your agent and the world.

```
Your Agent
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AgentWatch                │
│                                     │
│  1. Captures every reasoning step   │
│  2. Independent model scores it     │
│  3. Blocks dangerous actions        │
│  4. Fires alert if confidence drops │
│  5. Checkpoints for rollback        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
 The World (tools, APIs, databases)
```

The key insight: **an agent scoring its own reasoning is structurally biased toward overconfidence.** It almost always thinks it did well — even when it didn't.

AgentWatch deploys a second model, architecturally separate, with no access to the agent's own reasoning trace. Its only job: find failure before the next action fires.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install agentwatch

# Configure environment variables (optional)
# Copy the template and edit it to set custom DB passwords, API keys, etc.
cp .env.example .env

# Start the dashboard
docker compose up -d

# Wrap your agent
agentwatch watch "Build me a REST API"
```

**Dashboard** → http://localhost:3000  
**API Docs** → http://localhost:8000/docs

That's it. Zero config for default settings, or customize via the [.env.example](.env.example) file. Real data immediately.

## Core Features

### 🧠 Reasoning Auditor
The feature nobody else has built.

```python
from agentwatch.reasoning.auditor import ReasoningAuditor

auditor = ReasoningAuditor()
result = await auditor.score_step(step)

print(result.confidence)          # 0.0 – 1.0
print(result.hallucination_risk)  # low / medium / high  
print(result.goal_drift)          # True if agent is off-task
```

When confidence drops below your threshold, the next action is **held** — not logged after the fact. An alert fires. You decide what happens next.

---

### 🛡️ Safety Engine

```python
from agentwatch.core.safety import SafetyEngine

engine = SafetyEngine()
result = await engine.check_event(event)

if result.is_blocked:
    print(f"Blocked: {result.safety.reasons}")
    print(f"Risk level: {result.safety.risk_level.value}")
```

**Blocked by default:**
- `rm -rf /` · `curl | bash` · disk formatting
- Credential exfiltration · `DROP TABLE`
- Mass deletion · privilege escalation
- 40+ additional critical patterns

**Pre-execution. Not post-hoc logging.**

---

### ⏪ One-Click Rollback

```bash
agentwatch rollback <session-id> --to-step 12
```

Every step is a git-backed filesystem snapshot. Irreversible actions become reversible. Click rollback in the dashboard or use the CLI.

---

### 📊 Live Dashboard

Real-time WebSocket stream of every action your agent takes. Confidence meter updating per step. Colour-coded by span type. No polling. No refresh.

---

### 💾 Persistent Memory

Cross-session episodic, semantic, and procedural memory. Your agent remembers what it decided and why — across restarts, across sessions.

---

### 💰 Cost Intelligence

Per-session token budget with hard stop. Real-time spend tracking. Alerts at 80%. Blocks at 100%. Prevents runaway agents from bankrupting you overnight.

---

### 🔔 Alerting

Slack + PagerDuty when confidence drops or actions are blocked. Every alert contains full context — not just "something failed."

---
